# Python Turtle Mario

This is my final project for my Intro to Computer Science class. The goal of the project was to remake a classic video game in Python using classes and the turtle library. 

It is a remake of Mario's 1-1 using Python's turtle library. The replacement for Mario is my professor for the course, and he smushes minions to fight back against those who say he looks like Gru. 

The sprites for the character, the blocks, and the grass were made by the talented Anya Brewer. Along with that she and I collaborated in the design of the project, though the code is all mine. 

The game is played using WASD and the space bar. My personal high score is 2500!
